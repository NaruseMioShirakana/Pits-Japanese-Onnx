# PITS
**PITS: Variational Pitch Inference without Fundamental Frequency for End-to-End Pitch-controllable TTS**

**Abstract**: Previous pitch-controllable text-to-speech (TTS) models rely on directly modeling fundamental frequency, leading to low variance in synthesized speech. To address this issue, we propose PITS, an end-to-end pitch-controllable TTS model that utilizes variational inference to model pitch. Based on VITS, PITS incorporates the Yingram encoder, the Yingram decoder, and adversarial training of pitch-shifted synthesis to achieve pitch-controllability. Experiments demonstrate that PITS generates high-quality speech that is indistinguishable from ground truth speech and has high pitch-controllability without quality degradation. Code and audio samples will be available at https://github.com/anonymous-pits/pits.

**Training code is uploaded.**

**Demo and Checkpoint are uploaded at** [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/anonymous-pits/pits)🤗

Audio samples are uploaded at [github.io](https://anonymous-pits.github.io/pits/).

For the pitch-shifted Inference, we unify to use the notation in scope-shift, s, instead of pitch-shift.
